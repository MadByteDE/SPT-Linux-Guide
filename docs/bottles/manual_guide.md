**1. Install Runner**

- First thing on the menu is to install a new runner. To do so open Bottles and select the `Main Menu` button in the top right and navigate to the `Runners` tab. Here you can install the latest `wine-ge-proton` runner.

**2. New Bottle**

- Now we need to set up a new bottle to install EFT. Click on the `+` symbol at the top left. In the `Environment` section select `Gaming`, give it a name and click `Create` at the top right of the window.

**3. Setting the bottle up**

- Once your bottle is done, we have to configure it. Navigate to the `Settings` tab and select `wine-ge-proton` as `Runner` for the bottle.

-  Then go to the `Dependencies` tab and install the following dependencies:

       dotnet48 dotnetcoredesktop6 dotnetcoredesktop8 vcredist2022

    <img src="../../media/bottles/install_deps.gif" class="fit-picture">

- look for the `DLL Overrides` section and add `winhttp` - make sure it's as `Native, then Builtin`.
- And to finish up, select `Windows 8.1` as `Windows Version` to use for the bottle.

**4. Installing EFT**

- On your bottles main menu, click on `Run Executable` and look for the EFT launcher you downloaded earlier, keep in mind that bottles flatpak doesn't have permissions to read all your files, by default it'll only allow you to look in your downloads directory.

- Run through the installer as normal, log in and install the game.

- After you reach the `Play` button, you're free to close the launcher, and proceed with a regular manual SPT installation. (To browse the files inside your bottle go to the bottle main menu and click on the three dots at the top right, then `Browse files`).

**5. SPT directory / down-patching**

- Make a copy of your live EFT game files. You need to place it inside the same prefix, e.g at `~/.var/app/com.usebottles.bottles/data/bottles/bottles/SPTarkov/drive_c/SPTarkov`.

- If needed, downpatch EFT to the correct version e.g. by running the downgrade patcher inside the game directory. Check out our [downpatching guide](../downpatching.md).

- When it's done, extract the contents of the `RELEASE-SPT-x.x.x.zip` into your copied SPT game directory.

**6. Setting the shortcuts**

- Once you installed SPT, go to your bottle main menu and click `Add Shortcuts`.

- Look for the directory you installed SPT in (Reminder that you can click on the three dots at the top right and then `Browse files` to find the location of your bottle's C: directory) and add `SPT.Launcher.exe` and `SPT.Server.exe`.

**7. Running SPT**

- Everything now is pretty much done, so now to run the game we need to run the server and the launcher, HOWEVER to run the server we need to run it in a terminal, we do so by clicking the three dots at the right of the `SPT.Server` shortcut and then on the icon that looks like a terminal (If you hover over it, it should display `Launch with Terminal`).

- To run the launcher you just have to click on the play icon at the right side of the `SPT.Launcher` shortcut.
