## ASP.NET Runtime 9.0

[Website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)

To run the native Linux server you need to install the native ASP.NET Runtime 9 system package.

## How to install

**Ubuntu / Debian (based)**
```
sudo apt install aspnetcore-runtime-9.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> On some distributions you might need to add the `dotnet/backports` PPA:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dotnet/backports
sudo apt update
```
**Fedora (based)**
```
sudo dnf install aspnetcore-runtime-9.0
```

**Fedora Atomic (e.g. Bazzite/Aurora/Bluefin)**
```
rpm-ostree install aspnetcore-runtime-9.0
```

**Arch (based)**
```
sudo pacman -S aspnet-runtime
```

**Nixpkgs (NixOS or Other OS using Nix)**
> [!NOTE]
> This was accurate as of NixOS Stable version `25.05`, and the package name may have changed if using a newer version. Check [Here](https://search.nixos.org/packages?&query=aspnetcore) for the correct package name.

To install system-wide, add `dotnet-aspnetcore_9` to `environment.systempackages` in your `configuration.nix`.

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  dotnet-aspnetcore_9
];
```

Similarly, with home-manager, to install for your user only, add `dotnet-aspnetcore_9` to `home.packages` in your `home.nix`.
```nix
home.packages = with pkgs; [
  dotnet-aspnetcore_9
];
```
